# $PCC Token - Tokenomics v2 (Profit-Optimized)

## The Play

We're not launching a random memecoin. We're launching a **utility token with a real product** - that's rare on Clanker and that's our edge.

**Revenue streams:**
1. **LP fees** (5% of all trading volume fees → passive income forever)
2. **Platform fees** (when PCC pools go live)
3. **Token appreciation** (if platform grows, token grows)

---

## Supply: Keep It Simple

**Total Supply: 1,000,000 $PCC**

Clanker handles distribution automatically:
- **100% goes to Uniswap V3 LP** (locked forever)
- **You buy in first** with ETH on launch

### The Move
1. Deploy via Clanker (0 tokens in wallet)
2. Immediately buy with ~0.5-1 ETH (you're first buyer)
3. You now own tokens at floor price
4. Volume = LP fees = profit

**No "team allocation" that scares people off.** You earn by:
- Being first buyer (token appreciation)
- LP fee share (5% forever)
- Platform integration (utility drives demand)

## Virality Strategy

### Why People Will Buy

1. **Real Product** - PCC is a working mini app, not vaporware
2. **Utility** - Hold $PCC = benefits in the platform
3. **Narrative** - "DeFi for friend groups" is relatable
4. **Farcaster Native** - Built for the community that uses Clanker

### Launch Hype Playbook

**Pre-launch (1-2 days before):**
- Tease on Farcaster: "Building something for Farcaster friend groups 👀"
- Show PCC miniapp screenshots
- Build anticipation without revealing token

**Launch day:**
- Cast to @clanker with fire copy + image
- Immediately buy (be in first 10 buyers)
- Share contract address
- Post utility breakdown

**Post-launch:**
- Integrate $PCC into miniapp within 24-48 hours
- Announce staking/benefits
- Keep posting updates

## Initial Buy Strategy

**Goal:** Own 3-5% of supply at lowest price

Clanker tokens start at ~$3-5k mcap. If you're first buyer:

| ETH In | Approx % Supply | At $500k mcap |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| 0.1 ETH (~$280) | ~2-3% | $10-15k |
| 0.3 ETH (~$840) | ~5-7% | $25-35k |
| 0.5 ETH (~$1400) | ~8-10% | $40-50k |
| 1 ETH (~$2800) | ~12-15% | $60-75k |

**Recommendation:** 0.3-0.5 ETH initial buy
- Big enough to matter
- Small enough that selling won't tank price
- Shows confidence to other buyers

---

## What Makes This Different

Most Clanker tokens:
- Pure memes, no product
- Dump after initial pump
- Zero utility

$PCC:
- **Real product** (PCC miniapp live)
- **Real utility** (fee discounts, governance)
- **Deflationary** (burn on pool creation)
- **Revenue share** (hold = earn)

This isn't "launch and pray" - it's "launch and build."

## The Honest Math

**Worst case:** Token dies, you lose 0.3-0.5 ETH, but PCC platform still works.

**Base case:** $200-500k mcap, you make $5-20k on bag + $500-1500/month LP fees.

**Best case:** $1M+ mcap, 6-figure bag, $3k+/month passive LP fees.

**The edge:** We have a real product. Most Clanker tokens don't.
